# Hello, World!

> Electrik is a **source-available Laravel starter kit** that takes out the pain of building a SaaS application from scratch.

Electrik provides the core building blocks required by most SaaS products — including **recurring billing via Laravel Cashier**, **team support**, **roles and permissions**, and more — so you can focus on your product instead of boilerplate.

---

## Why another Laravel starter kit?

There are many excellent Laravel SaaS starter kits available today.

Electrik exists to offer a **full-featured, accessible foundation** for developers who want to learn, experiment, and build real SaaS products without being forced into early paywalls or artificially limited feature sets.

The Community Edition includes the complete feature set, making it suitable for:
- Indie hackers and solo developers
- Learning and experimentation
- Open-source projects
- Pre-revenue SaaS ideas

For companies and professional use, Electrik offers a **clear commercial license** to support long-term maintenance and development.
