# Hello, World!

> Electrik is a Laravel package and a starter kit that takes out the pain of building a SaaS application from scratch. 

Electrik provides all the core features that are required for any SaaS. For example, it supports **recurring billing via cashier**, **multiple teams**, User configurable **roles and permissions**, and much much more.

## Why Another Laravel Starter Kit?

It's true that there are a lot of Laravel SaaS starter kits available on the Internet and they are bloody good too. What breaks my heart is that almost every of these SaaS starter kits has two versions, one free, and one paid. These kits in their free versions, provide the bare minimum features. Some would lock billing as a paid feature and others would block team management as a paid feature. In my view, this is exactly what OSS philosophy is not. I am not at all saying that they should not charge for their creations. What I am saying is that there should be an open-source, 100% free, and full-featured alternative also available for people to choose from. My intention is just that.
